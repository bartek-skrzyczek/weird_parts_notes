do not imitate, understand!

syntax parser: interpreters?
execution context: where something sits physically in the code
lexical environment

name/value pair: name can be defined more than once, but only can have only one value in any given context
Address = 'NY' is a name/value pair

object is collection of name value pairs

Address:
  {

        Street: 'Main',
        Number: 100,
        Apartment:
        {
          Floor: 3,
          Number: 102
        }
  }

global execution context, global object and special variable called this

execution context: global object, this, outer environment, your code

hoisting: functions are existing in memory, so they can be accessed
all variables and functions are initially set to undefined!!!

single threaded one command at a time!
synchronous execution: one line at a time!

execution stack one on top of each other on top of each other;
every time a function is called, a new execution context is created;

variable environment: where variable lives
